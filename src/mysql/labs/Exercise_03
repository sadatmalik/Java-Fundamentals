*  MySQL Exercise 3:
*
*   Now that you have your air travel database all set up and populated, please demonstrate how to:
*
*       1.) Query all flights on a specific day

SELECT * FROM flights
WHERE CAST(departure_time AS DATE) = '2021-09-08';


*       2.) Query all flights between two specific cities on a specific day

SELECT * FROM flights
WHERE CAST(departure_time AS DATE) = '2021-09-08'
AND source IN (1, 6)
AND destination IN (1, 6);


*       3.) Query all passengers on a specific flight between two specific cities today

SELECT f.id AS flight_id, p.*
FROM passengers p
JOIN tickets t
ON p.id = t.passenger_id
JOIN flights f
ON t.flight_id = f.id
WHERE CAST(f.departure_time AS DATE) = '2021-09-08'
AND source IN (1, 6)
AND destination IN (1, 6)
AND f.id = 7;

*       4.) Query the flight information for a specific passenger on a specific flight

SELECT DISTINCT f.*
FROM flights f
JOIN tickets t
ON f.id = t.flight_id
JOIN passengers p
ON t.passenger_id = p.id
WHERE p.id = 1 AND f.id = 8;

*       5.) Query the passenger information for a specific user on a specific flight yesterday

SELECT p.*
FROM passengers p
JOIN tickets t
ON p.id = t.passenger_id
JOIN flights f
ON t.flight_id = f.id
WHERE CAST(f.departure_time AS DATE) = '2021-09-07'
AND f.id = 7
AND p.id = 3;


*       6.) Query the number of flights between two specific cities this week, month, and year

SELECT COUNT(id)
FROM flights
WHERE source = 1
AND destination = 6
AND CAST(departure_time AS DATE) > '2021-09-07'
AND CAST(departure_time AS DATE) < '2021-09-14';


*       7.) Query the number of passengers that travelled between two specific cities today, this week, month and year

SELECT COUNT(p.id)
FROM passengers p
JOIN tickets t
ON p.id = t.passenger_id
JOIN flights f
ON t.flight_id = f.id
WHERE f.source = 1
AND f.destination = 6
AND CAST(f.departure_time AS DATE) > '2021-09-07'
AND CAST(f.departure_time AS DATE) < '2021-09-14';


*       8.) Insert records for new flights between airports

INSERT INTO flights (plane_id, airline_id, flight_num, source, departure_time, destination, arrival_time)
VALUES (1, 1, 'BA009', 1, '2021-09-08 16:50:00', 14, '2021-09-08 23:00:00');


*       9.) Insert records for new tickets and passengers on specific flights

INSERT INTO tickets (passenger_id, flight_id)
VALUES (2, 6);


*       10.) Update meal preference (or something similar) for a specific passenger on a specific flight
*       Bonus: Have some fun - get creative - what else can you do? Flex those SQL muscles and show us what
*           you've got! :)

* @TODO -- 10.)
