 SELECT t.first_name, t.last_name, c.name
 FROM teachers t
 JOIN courses c
 ON t.subject = c.id
 WHERE c.name = 'data science';


 *          c. use a join query to select all students with a certain teacher

 SELECT s.first_name, s.last_name, s.email
 FROM students s
 JOIN teachers_students ts
 ON s.id = ts.student_id
 JOIN teachers t
 ON ts.teacher_id = t.id
 WHERE t.id = 1;


 *          d. use a join query to select all students with taking a certain subject

 SELECT s.first_name, s.last_name, s.email, c.name
 FROM students s
 JOIN students_courses sc
 ON s.id = sc.student_id
 JOIN courses c
 ON sc.course_id = c.id
 WHERE sc.course_id = 3;
