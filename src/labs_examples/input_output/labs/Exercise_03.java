/**
 * Input/Output Exercise 3: variety
 *
 *    1) Demonstrate the usage of at least two additional Byte Streams
 *    Already used :
 *    FileInputStream / FileOutputStream
 *    BufferedInputStream / BufferedOutputStream
 *
 *    Part 4 below : will use DataInputStream / DataOutputStream
 *
 *    For 1) :
 *    SequenceInputStream
 *    ByteArrayInputStream / ByteArrayOutputStream
 *    ObjectInputStream / ObjectOutputStream
 *
 *    LineNumberInputStream -- deprecated -- use character streams as of Java 1.1
 *    StringBufferInputStream -- deprecated -- use StringReader
 *
 *    PipedInputStream / PipedOutputStream (@TODO come back and finish this after MultiThreading section)
 *
 *
 *    2) Demonstrate the usage of at least two additional Character Streams
 *    Already used:
 *    FileReader / FileWriter
 *    BufferedReader / BufferedWriter
 *
 *    For 2)
 *    LineNumberReader
 *    CharArrayReader / CharArrayWriter
 *    StringReader / StringWriter
 *
 *    PipedReader / PipedWriter (@TODO come back and finish this after MultiThreading section)
 *
 *
 *    3) Demonstrate using a buffer on one of the Byte Streams and one of the Character Streams
 *    4) Demonstrate the use of the DataInputStream and DataOutputStream
