     Perform the following tasks using the CLI and copy and paste the commands and results below

     1. Navigate to CodingNomads folder (or the space you have create for this project)
     cd Desktop/java-projects/CodingNomads

     2. Create new folder Terminal_testing
     mkdir Terminal_testing

     3. Inside of folder Terminal_testing,
         a. create 3 new .txt files all with different names
         cd Terminal_testing
         touch one.txt two.txt three.txt

         b. print the directory path
         pwd
         > /Users/sadatmalik/Desktop/java-projects/CodingNomads/

         c. list the contents of the folder
         ls -al
         total 0
         drwxr-xr-x  5 sadatmalik  staff  160  2 Aug 12:40 .
         drwxr-xr-x  6 sadatmalik  staff  192  2 Aug 12:39 ..
         -rw-r--r--  1 sadatmalik  staff    0  2 Aug 12:40 one.txt
         -rw-r--r--  1 sadatmalik  staff    0  2 Aug 12:40 three.txt
         -rw-r--r--  1 sadatmalik  staff    0  2 Aug 12:40 two.txt


     5. Inside of folder Terminal_testing, create a new folder
     mkdir new

     6. Copy a file from Terminal_testing to the new folder
     cp one.txt new

     7. Move a different file from Terminal_testing to the new folder

     8. Demonstrate removing:
         a. A file
         rm three.txt

         b. A folder

         grep text file.txt
         > some text

Example Output (pwd):
    1. Cadens-MacBook-Pro:CodingNomads cadenmackenzie$ pwd
       /Users/cadenmackenzie/Documents/CodingNomads
