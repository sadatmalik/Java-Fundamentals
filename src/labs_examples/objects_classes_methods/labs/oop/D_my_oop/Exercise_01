For this exercise please model and build your own Object-Oriented Application. You can build whatever you want.
Demonstrate your understanding of Encapsulation, Inheritance and Polymorphism - as well as all the other skills you
now have. Be creative. Have fun. Challenge yourself. What would you like to build? A restaurant service? A rock climbing
application? An interactive model of the universe? An application to help biologists? A financial trading application?
A payroll and HR application? Is there something you could use in your day to day life that you could build an
application around?

Imagine it, design it, build it, test it. Have some fun. Reach out anytime you're stuck.
