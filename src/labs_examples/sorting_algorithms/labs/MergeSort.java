/**
 * The Merge sort is a divide and conquer algorithm that was invented by John
 * von Neumann in 1945. A detailed description and analysis of bottom-up mergesort
 * appeared in a report by Goldstine and von Neumann as early as 1948.
 *
 * Conceptually, a merge sort works as follows:
 *
 * 1. Divide the unsorted list into n sub-lists, each containing one element (a list
 * of one element is considered sorted).
 *
 * 2. Repeatedly merge sub-lists to produce new sorted sub-lists until there is only
 * one sub-list remaining. This will be the sorted list.
